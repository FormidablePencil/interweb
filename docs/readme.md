# The Vision

For people to do what they love to do and having only that to be a requirement to sustain themselves. This project is an
attempt to make this a reality. The theory this project is based on is doing what you love manifests the likeness of
that which you loved.

The bridge this projects creates from where we are in society to the vision is creating a platform to reach people of
which are in your interests. By having content online is like having you, yourself online for people to come across. If
you create your portfolio in such a way that appeals to the people you are interested in and in a platform that is
tailored for this use case then those people will reach out to you.

- Find friends, find like-minded or those with similar interests.
- Business ventures. Find those who with a Subject(Author-Spaces) that's impressive to you and vise-verse, create and
  organize your content that will appeal to those you are interested in.
- Organize your content if you're a content creator like a youtuber or blog writer. - Platform might replace books some
  day.
