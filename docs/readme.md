  value web3 is about more than just for web. The Julia project is an attempt at that. I'm Ukrainian by blood, so I
  think I can speak unbiasedly on the matter.

  the product itself, so it's worth covering.

## Preface

Imagine a world where meeting interesting people was as simple as googling for information. In today's world, we are
often in a position where we play catch 22 in hoping to meet favorable people and yet feeling that we need to already
introduce you to them and likewise in professional work, needing experience for a job and yet you need a job to gain
experience. It makes trying to get from where you are to where you want to be extremely difficult which leads many to be
intrusive and impostures just to get anywhere in life.

Julia is attempt to solve the paradox of the world being more connected but yet individuals isolated and lonely than
ever before. Currently, the project is around 15k lines of code and heavily tested though itâ€™s not even near its
completion. I've written quite extensively on it in this site. The reset on this page is to peruse this idea
superficially. Follow the links to or navigate through the sidebar to go deeper.

## The Julia project and what it consists of

Julia represents an idea most of all than a specific app or service. The ambition is to truly connect the world together
as never been before according to the [vision that came to me](/vision). We'll present the 2 most important parts for
this idea to work.

### Social utility

The first part is the actual product of which is based on the web3 paradigm. To paint a quick picture, imagine the idea
is like a Tinder app but for general social purposes as well as a combination of Tinder, Facebook and YouTube in that it
is for content creators but specifically for social purposes which ultimately allows people/users to create content/data
into a Tinder like search engine in order to find and be found by people sought out for by keywords and criteria, along
with the app(s) (social utilities) being completely secure, private and censor resistant by basing it on the web3
paradigm. That is the gist of the idea though we dive deeper in the [Julia section](/main/juliaWhitepaper).

### DataWallet

The second part is what I coined a data-wallet which is actually more of a necessity for the web3 paradigm as a whole to
flourish than direct part of the Julia idea I present. To understand its role in the web3 paradigm it would be useful to
briefly paraphrase what web3 is about though I expound on it, and it's absolute necessity for society in
the [decentralized approach section](). The Web3 paradigm creates an even-playing-field for all interested in creating
services without the need of centralizing data. This ultimately will bread a plethora of very diverse and specialized
services though by having a unix philosophy like paradigm of modularizing services the problem web3 poses is in putting
the responsibility on the user to own their own data. This means that the USER has to keep track of their own data! So
to solve and substantially mitigate this problem there must be a so-called "source of truth" for user data. A central
store of user data is what a data-wallet is. The difference between a centralized entity of the web2 world is that it's
truly owned by the user. I dive deeper of a data-wallet in the [DataWallet Whitepaper](/main/dataWalletWhitepaper).

*Though truth be told, there might be a protocol like this, but I hadn't seen it yet, and I personally need it to be
built in such a way as to support my endeavor in bringing the Julia product idea into fruiting.*

### What's next?

Because of web3; a decentralized approach to the web, this product Julia was made possible. I dive deep into the
overwhelming explosion of possibility of freedom and opportunity the
[decentralized web opens to society a whitepaper of sorts](/main/whyDecentralizedApproach). Ultimately, web3 truly a
technology that liberates society of its entanglement in itself and creates new possibilities for harmony and
prosperity.
