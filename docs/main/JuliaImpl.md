### Current progress

Currently, the project is set up a centralized entity for simplicity for now. The codebase is built in Kotlin and consists mostly of 
cms functionality, and it will be converted to a KMM project be used directly by as an external library targeting android and 
compile to js to target the and to swift target ios.

As the project got bigger and ideas became intricate I soon realized this project was going to be massive.
At the moment, Julia is nearly 15k lines of code ðŸ˜•.
