# Ukraine-Russia War.

### There is one cause and one cause only. It's systemic and not geo-political.

I think it's absurd to have a system to control millions of people. Because at the end of the day it's people are to enforce
the laws and regulations, so, you're going to have corruption either way. The only way a society is to an ideal is through
understanding which only comes from experience and a genuine desire for so. As I see it, the more solutions we find the
more complicated problems we get. It's like trimming the weeds in a garden when what you need is the rip out the root.

The governments and politicians make decisions on behalf of millions of people through mass mainstream manipulation of narratives, 
giving the illusion of choice, fear-mongering, and worst of all, posing as some savior! The only when who can save you is you and you alone
if that's already not self-evident. Who knows you more than you, or who can know you more than you? No one can, because you live most intimately
with yourself for the reset of your life, so it would be a good idea to get to know yourself and make something beautiful out of yourself.
I say this because looking outside yourself for salvation is the biggest illusion the world has perpetrated.

Look at how our current day systems work. We listen to some politician, but we are the ones to implement their decisions 
and enforce them through indirect and direct means such as taxes and the sending of our kids and loved one's to war
and all in the name of peace and freedom. Isn't it ironic to waging war for peace. I would go further to argue that the reason why people feel averse
to pay taxes isn't mostly because people are greedy but because the current systems of government isn't very helpful.

And what keeps it up is our complying to its demands in fueling its existence through taxes and
force and intimidation through the very mainstream mediums is what keeps many 
giving nearly 3-4 months of a year's worth of work in the form of money
to the government and the few pulling the strings of keeping everyone in a mass comma of fear and anxiety.
For those who are on the fence about whether the government is for a greater good and want to support
it then you have the free will to do so but those who are opposed to it should be entitled to their own beliefs instead of enforcing 
the law to imprison those that simply choice to evade taxes for personal reasons is absurd.

In the case of the Ukraine and Russia war, many russian offenders don't know why they are waging war against their brotherly
nation, some are just afraid to oppose to system, some allowed themselves to fall into the propaganda of mainstream media
and most are in it because of a little-bit of all these reason. Look, it doesn't make sense, there was no profit or no benefit
of procuring securing, as if security is procured. I'm not trying to be another conspiracy theorist, I'm just pointing
out the obvious. Ukraine bans all men from the age of 18-60 from leaving the country in the 21st century and all in the name
of freedom and peace. This is as far as I'll go with the conflict in Russian and Ukraine, so I digress because it's not
for me to make anyone believe in any particular narrative. It has many layers of implications and for each individual means
differently to them. In essence, the problem is group thinking of which the solution is thinking outside the box, for the latter
is frameworks of thinking that are meant for one aim and one aim only; to lead the sheep to the slaughter. The sheep are
the gullible. Though slavery is of the past, financial slavery is a global pandemic much worse than any other pandemic in the 21st century.

### The silver-lining

*Rise and shine sleepy one.*

We are beginning to see the string of the wizards of oz, the matrix. There will be no one to enforce the will of many
when the methods and tactics become so blatantly obvious.
