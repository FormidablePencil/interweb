## DataWallet Whitepaper

DataWallet definition - A smart contract protocol that acts as a source of truth for user's data
for services to query, and for the owners be used as a management tool; a CMS so to speak.

Web3, where data is freed from the control of centralization by centralized entities of which have their own agendas. I wrote
extensively on the problem of centralization of power in this [article](main/whyDecentralizedApproach). Web3.0 is a solution
to the critical problems of today times but as a consequence of solutions breed new problems. In having a paradigm where the user
is in full ownership of their own data makes the end user be the source of their own data for services to query. The problem
however is that the data is still siloed. So, if the user is going to truly own data, the feature to share data across services
is compromised but the solution of which is what I coined a data-wallet. a data-wallet acts as a source of truth for user's data
to services to query and for the owners, a management tool, a CMS so to speak.

To put it into some relatable perspective, the data-wallet is like a global store like Redux in React land or the database 
in backend from which components and services query from. It can also be a state where services may listen to.

Because of the freedom from the lock in of data in centralized systems, the Web3 ecosystem will in time
look more like a unix based philosophy of design where each service is specialized to do one thing. That is why
a data-wallet, a system for a source of truth of user's data is necessary, that way, an update in one central place triggers
an update in all services.

I should be clear that a data-wallet is not centralized but rather an aggregator of data.
^ expound that the key are store to ipfs box and that the box can be viewed but nothing changed. - A detail report will be done in the implementation section.

Elaborate on the pain of trying to manage personal data and predict that's the reason why people aren't so keen in maintaining
and creating content and therefore myspace failed and services with simpler features like a wall feed and the limitation in
only customizing a profile picture prevailed.

Then after ^ argue that the world is ready to manage their own data and that people wanting simplicity is a false statement,
argue that people don't like simplicity because life is all about profundity and innovation. People don't mind hard work
when they're in a gold mine. #ROI ðŸ¤ª



this opens up developers to create diverse and specialized services

because of the freeing of centralized entities like Facebook which ultimately
a centralized identity is a monopoly roughly speaking and creates an environment of diverse and specialized services.

    1. Why this is critical to the web3 paradigm - lacks the benefits of centralization.
        - This has to be for Julia or any application to succeed and be potent in web3.
    2. Why I believe the world is ready to manage their own data - because they want to and who wouldn't since it would be awesome given that the ability with the ease to do so is provided.
        - Central ownership of data.
    3. The solution DataWallet provides to web3 critical problem - the how and why this way and not the other.
