We live predominantly in a society of centralized control which if you know the structure, it looks like a pyrimid where
it's possible to real the whole world by a handful of people.

creating other alternatives
for the body of society to depend on to stay informed on what's happening globally.

In a world all the abuse of centralized power is pervasive, Putin forcing 18 year old kids to war on a brotherly country and Ukraine
restricting all men from the age of 18-60 from leaving the country, the sensorship of large tech platforms behind the
mask of cancel culture, an infringment of bodily autonomy through vaccine mandates, centralized money and attempting to
ban it under the name of "regulation", the control of narratives through mainstream media, legal tax evasion by the powerful
and threats of imprisionment if you choose to evade, a system made to keep the rich rich and the poor poor. The
government was made to serve the people and not vise-versa which we see through various means of exploitation of power.

Decentralized approach - just a necessary benefit


[comment]: <> (More of the decentralized approach section)
A college degree only signifies that you are submissible/submitable/controllable to top to bottom hierarchy approach, that's it
other than that, all that's needed is that you can do the job. The chain of command, top management, middle management
and the people that actually do the job - people don't need to be managed, they are capable of and deserve individual sovereignty.
The many have to vote a few to "lead" a country but to where, why lead, I ain't no sheep!
The point is that this mentality to impose and adhere to a top to bottom hierarchical structure of control pervades our society.

### An abstract point of view of what’s happening with our times

We are moving into an era of truth and those who have been untruthful to one another fear, for they will be exposed.

### A quick recap of what the blockchain aims to solve

The blockchain won’t bring new features and shiny new things for people to indulge in link NFTs and crypto trading fads
have taken blockchain to be. The blockchain simply is a technology to replace the underlying foundation upon which the
current services of today are built on. So, our lifestyles won’t change with it we gain so much in the security of our
privacy.

The paradigm the blockchain aims to support is the removing all hopeful trust to the powers that be and back to the
hands of the individual.

The governments and large corporations of today are centralized powers of authority. You have to trust that whatever
they are responsible for they will do right by you. With the instance of the government, you have to trust that your tax
dollars are utilized properly, you have to trust that the dollar isn’t intentionally devalued by the deliberate printing
of money. You have to trust that the information gathered by corporates and governments isn’t leaked, sold or used
against you. That’s a lot of trust with little to no accountability. It baffles me that people think that username and
password prevents others from accessing their personal information when the database where which all your data is stored
is accessible to the higher ups in the companies. How could these people that hold that master keys to our data be held
accountable when selling this data for personal profit only needs to be copied and pasted unlike tangible goods if it’s
been stolen you would know. You can’t know who has what kind of data about you and thus is so dangerous to entrust the
collection of your data to other people. After all, if they didn’t profit for it, they wouldn’t collect it. That’s why
Facebook, instagram and YouTube is free to use. You are the product. The most troubling thing about giving your data to
something is how they’ll use it. Look at Uber’s ‘god mode’ for example, with it it shows the location of all uber riders
and customers. It sounds like it could be useful for good but with all power, it’s a double edged sword. It’s not the
sword that inflicts evil until others, it’s the welder that swings it at those for his own personal good. Why would
Facebook, YouTube, or the government care if they aren’t held accountable. It’s been said that data is power in the form
of the phrase ‘knowledge is power’, in other words if you know, you have the power to change and control whatever you
know. That explains why we are so addicted to the products produced by the system. It pulls the strings behind the
curtain.

### The blockchain solves two dilemmas

The control of money(link to video explaining) by creating a system where money cannot be minted by anyone individual,
there be a consensus for a change to happen, neither can it shut down even if it’s outlawed. The products of this
intention is bitcoin and to some extent ethereum. Truly secure data unlike how it is now where your data is accessible
by the higher ups at the companies you entrust it with.

**We’ll be expounding on the second dilemma**

Traditionally a central database was used to store data. Though you could have a mechanism to lock your data from others
tempering with it, and restricting the sharing of it, the problem is that you couldn’t trust the code that would be that
because it’s inaccessible to the user and would have to trust the companies by their words. So, this mechanism doesn’t
exist. Furthermore, what prevents companies to persist your data even after you removed it through their user interface?
You don’t have permission to view their logic that handles your data. Note: It’s alright to have a concealed codebase
but when people that work on it come and go and a lot of money and power comes into it then you don’t know who you’re
entrusting. You just have to hope they follow the ideals they say to be.

The alternative is an immutable codebase which the blockchain gives an opportunity for. Ethereum is the leading
blockchain and with already many layer 2 solutions built for scalability… Explain how ethereum achieves immutability and
what it means in removing the middleman.

We are moving towards an age of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), these are what are considered as dapps. To
achieve sharing data without entrusting “authorities” to keep it secure, there must be a storage mechanism where only
you have the ability to modify data and have it be decentralized. There are systems that already do that. IPFS for
instance. The challenge is to have your data easily accessible by you, that’s why a lot of frontend needs to be
developed, and not be tranced by any program to collect your data easily (only having the human manual work search by
name and human collecting your data). The solution of creating this system where no service has access to your data
firstly has to have the code be public and secondly the data must circulate in that environment without it copying your
data or organizing it in a way that’s not necessary but to discriminate against you.

Ofcourse, there’s no way to prevent people from copying your data just as much as there’s no way to prevent people from
taking a screenshot of your information or web scrapping for more sophisticated and automated copying online. However,
the difference is that tracing your data will be a hard manual task to do and scaling to handling of tracing and storing
a large mass of people’s data would be practically impossible. At the moment, a mass database of our information is
stored already for our convenience of features like the kind that Facebook and Instagram provides but at the expense of
already having the world’s private data at their finger tips. Another difference is that there would be no way of
proving that the copied data is true and thus renders the seller of your data useless. Ultimately, it’s you sharing data
and only you being able to validate the authenticity of ownership through asymmetric encryption. If you can validate it
with a private key, then it’s yours. This will prevent others from making copies of your profile somewhere down the
line. Having a system where your content that contains your image like videos and photos can validate the authenticity
of the ownership of your content to give as a certificate of validation. Those accounts that fail to validate get
removed from the autonomous system. This is Python, machine learning and AI. It has to be free from the hands of any one
individual, other words, there can’t be any group of people pulling the strings even if it’s best that someone does
because it defeats the purpose of a trustless system. (well, gives me a reason to learn machine learning, AI and lower
level languages later down the road since a Facebook replica is what I’m building).

[comment]: <> (- Full disclosure. These clips are not mine.)


Now that the tangible real world and theoretical is out of the way, we’ll get technical with how these autonomous
systems around our data will be built.

### Why spend time and resources to build another Facebook and YouTube?

Because people value privacy so wherever there's a need there's an opportunity, that's where venture capitalist and
entrepreneurs, the pioneers of new ideas will be.

### The technical side that needs to be built Can it be stopped?

People have been wanting the alternative to the current ways that the world operates by. Try to outlaw it, suppress it,
demonize it but nothing stops people from getting what they want. Eventually the dam of desire will bust open. The more
people want it the stronger you have to build that damn. If you can’t beat them join them. Why go against the grain?

### Why go through all the trouble of building this?

Why not, it’s fun, it’s right, it’s a loving thing to do. Unless you deem this world to be meaningless then get
ready to be enlightened!😁
