## Preface (no need for this header)
We live in a world where we can buy any earthly thing with a click of a button and learn about anything with the stroke of
a keyboard. We have never been more connected thanks to technology yet loneliness and depression is more pervasive than ever before.
We feed on social media, racking up likes yet in pursuit of validating a self-image by sucking up to others in hopes
that they do in turn. Technology like everything is a doubled edged sword. People can create
environments conducive for the flourishing of life and well-being with innovation or weapons of mass destruction
that only benefit in monetary gain and keeping the nation's people hostage through fear and manipulation. How pitiful
the latter had reigned this world for many centuries if not a millennia. We could really well get along with one another
if the world stopped singing their national anthems and instead identified themselves with the world at large. 
As astronauts pointed out that there is no borders between us. The imaginary borders that separate country from country 
and state from state are purely imaginary!

Today we live in a transitory period of great change technologically, socially and mentally. More and more people are considering
alternatives to mainstream thinking. Many have lost trust in institutions and instead are carving their own paths for
success and well-being. The current systems won't survive and new systems will need to be built to replace them, and where there's a
necessity for change, there's an opportunity to make a difference. The times are very exciting despite the horrors of
today which are a sign of great change, from fear based thinking to something more predominantly rational in my humble opinion.



The only thing there is
to fear is our own sheep like ignorance in giving up our power to the powers that be.

It's fear-mongering by which these jokes work by which induces us to turn on one another.

Inevitably they make laws to their liking and get us to impose and 
uphold them!

## I have a dream
"No one puts new wine into old wineskin". So, I ask to suspend your current understanding of the world, that way I could present
an alternative view and deductively reason from it; bringing heaven to earth so to speak.

Imagine a world where people create things out of passion in their personal dreams and aspirations, where self-expression
is not condemned but encouraged, where following your passions will instead be supported by others and the hurt are loved
and understood. Imaging an environment built for connecting people together, maybe a set of utilities with the help of technology to search
through 7.5 billion people in the world to filter into one's awareness by certain criterias. Imagine being having a utility to make a query to search
like-minded individuals or a query to search for certain people you could work with to meet some common goal. So just as you narrow down and filter 
information by criteria on Google and videos on YouTube so could you narrow down by criteria a handful of people of our earth's population
(that is of course who they opt in to be a part of). This in my mind would be the biggest technological breakthrough and
an extremely disruptive one to the current system to date.

This dream encapsulates a lot of nuances to address but before we do so, it's important to address the utter failures of the
current systems in place and my personal concerns of the world which birthed my dreams...


## The utter failure of current systems in social utilities space
| loneliness in an ever "connected" society, more like a controlled society - talk about how the systems are not
conducive for connecting people together
| current systems are limited in ease of self-expression; youtube playlists and scrollable wall feeds
| there is no system like this unfortunately, something what facebook failed at and maybe even intentionally, free flow information doesn't and ridding the necessity for 3rd parties doesn't seem good

The current systems of today don't support this kind of reality. One of these systems is facebook. If you
think about it, it's features is quite simple and even limiting in self-expression. You can only customize your profile
picture and post content on your wall feed, myspace provides more customisability for self-expression. We know that a
platform of self-expression is needed by the explosion of TicTok though this is limited as well.
the current systems are not conducive for this reality.
For people to do what they love to do and having only that to be a requirement to sustain themselves
doing what you love manifests the likeness of that which you loved.

As a content creator myself and one who needs better systems to support a structure my work.

### A growing necessity for alternative forms to current systems of social utilities
In a world all the abuse of centralized power is pervasive, from the government to large tech companies,
there is a huge necessity for alternative structures for society. Where there's a necessities there are opportunities to
and wherever there are opportunities there gather genius minds. The current standing social media platforms among other 
pressing (necessities for reform and alternatives built on a centralized power of control paradigm)(link to other pressing necessities such as money and dao)
made monopolized through data hording and various means of (market control)(https://www.promarket.org/2020/02/14/facebooks-enduring-control-over-social-media-markets/)
have control over the perception of masses through their various algorithms. The features of the facebook app
I would argue are very simple other than the algorithms. These algorithms are practically pointless for consumers.
The algorithms adjust according to the individual's psychology based on (every little detail they track)(details of what facebook tracks).
Not only is their complex algorithms virtually useless for the consumer, these algorithms have been perfected to retain
the attention of viewers through curating content around their individual's psychology. Not only are the algorithms are
useless to the consumer, they can be tweaked and adjusted to favor one narrative than another for political or other purposes.
So, as the masses wake up to see what facebook really, they will consider other alternatives like one's free from central control.

### The alternative is Web3 appears which is the future
Web3 is new but an ever maturing alternative for set of utilities for society which are trustless in nature.
Ever since bitcoin presented itself as a controllable form of money or in other words "unregulatable"
we have extrapolated its underlining technology to other aspects of society such as DAOs of which an idea of making fair governmental systems
held up by code and maintained by the community possible and Dapps which are apps that can be truly decentralized thus censorship resistant,
trustless and have no central point of failure (for the most part that is).

### I invite you to see a metaphor by which I perceive social utilities based on a centralized model (this is more on for why decentralized)
Any utility like a social platform that society largely depend on must be prone from failures and corruption. A mystic 
once said "If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast from you,
for it is good to you that one of your members may perish than the whole body be cast into turmoil." See that 
if a part of the body of society fails, the whole society will collapse also, and just
for fun, imagine that the symbolism of the eye is one's consciousness (causing the whole body to stumble is our perception) 
which was hijacked or captivated by the luring content curated by
algorithms which were purposefully built for their own benefit. You can stop consuming their content which metaphorically you would
pluck out your eye though will prevent you from seeing what's going on globally but will save you from its pits of hell because that sense of perception was corrupted.
On a global level, pluck the eye would be by refusing to participate engaging with whatever facebook has to offer, after all they need you to survive.
Just as each member of the body contributes in gathering, feeding and maintaining the health of the whole body in 
delivering nutrients through the circulation of the blood (little do people know, this is what the blood of Christ means and not literal cannibalism).
The corruption of the system is cancer to the body which feeds and lives off the host, why does anyone need so much money and power?!

## How this alternative social utility would work in a nutshell

The model of DataWallet is a necessity for this to work and web3 in general.

## My personal experiences from which these ideas sprung

My true reason for Julia is stemmed from a personal experience of loneliness... and sympathy for the lonely which I believe
is because of the predominant belief system in the need of a top down, hierarchical approach of control for any society or organization to function.
So, instead of maintaining a relationship between people built on trust and respect in order to get things done, we have
a paradigm of control and submission based on threat and fear. So, there's no room for love, friendship and trust, the
faminine qualities of mankind which have been suppressed over the ages.

The name Julia was of a loved one who passed away in a car accident, the name is symbolic
of the beautiful virtues of love, life, trust and happiness to me so  unlike my initial thought for a name InterWeb, sounds mechanical
and impersonal.
