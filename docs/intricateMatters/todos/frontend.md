# Frontend todos

## Features

1. Author wall(s), the sort of space
2. Nesting topics in subjects and subjects in spaces
3. And obviously a way to post various kinds of content: vid, message, blog, links, embedded or imported

4. I'm thinking having a library of content and author sorts them differently for every layout/space

## Frontend technologies

- Kmm
- Jetpack composed
- Swift UI

Does kmm have a dependency injection system or can we use hilt?
How would you import and use shared logic in swift code and android code? 
Do you make http requests to the server from the shared kotlin logic and if so how to do it?
Are there concepts in mobile, android and ios development I need to follow like in the React or Vue frameworks had me to?

## Frontend Web

- create error logging, create TokenHandler, dependency inject TokenHandler,
- networking and unit testing
- then feature building. There is still and android and ios network setup to do
- implement a similar fetch handler as I did in android
- save tokens locally
